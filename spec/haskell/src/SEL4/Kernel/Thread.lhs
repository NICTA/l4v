\subsection{Idle Thread Creation}

The idle thread must halt execution and wait for an interrupt to occur, at which point the kernel will be re-entered with an Interrupt event. The following function configures a given TCB to do this when activated.

> configureIdleThread :: PPtr TCB -> KernelInit ()
> configureIdleThread tcb = do
>     Arch.configureIdleThread tcb
>     doKernelOp $ setThreadState IdleThreadState tcb

\subsection{Initial Thread Creation}

This function activates the initial user-level thread. It sets the
first argument register and the program counter, sets the thread's
state so it can be scheduled, and then switches to the thread.
The initial user-level thread has the right to change the security domains of other threads.

> activateInitialThread :: PPtr TCB -> VPtr -> VPtr -> Kernel ()
> activateInitialThread threadPtr entry infoPtr = do
>         asUser threadPtr $ setRegister capRegister $ fromVPtr infoPtr
>         asUser threadPtr $ setNextPC $ fromVPtr entry
>         setThreadState Running threadPtr
>         setSchedulerAction ResumeCurrentThread
>         idle <- getIdleThread
>         setCurThread idle
>         switchToThread threadPtr

\subsection{Thread Activation}

The "activateThread" function is used to prepare a thread to run. If the thread is in the "Restart" state, then it is running for the first time, resuming after a fault, or restarting an aborted system call; in any of these cases, it will start running at the current instruction. Otherwise, it starts running at the next instruction.

> activateThread :: Kernel ()
> activateThread = do
>         thread <- getCurThread
>         state <- getThreadState thread
>         case state of
>             Running -> return ()
>             Restart -> do
>                 pc <- asUser thread $ getRestartPC
>                 asUser thread $ setNextPC pc
>                 setThreadState Running thread
>             IdleThreadState -> do
>                 Arch.activateIdleThread thread
>             _ -> fail $ "Current thread is blocked, state: " ++ show state

\subsection{Thread State}

The following functions are used by the scheduler to determine whether a particular thread is ready to be scheduled, and whether it is ready to run.

> isBlocked :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel Bool
> isBlocked thread = do
>         state <- getThreadState thread
>         return $ case state of
>             Inactive -> True
>             BlockedOnReceive {} -> True
>             BlockedOnSend {} -> True
>             BlockedOnNotification {} -> True
>             BlockedOnReply -> True
>             _ -> False

Note that the idle thread is not considered runnable; this is to prevent it being inserted in the scheduler queue.

> isRunnable :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel Bool
> isRunnable thread = do
>         state <- getThreadState thread
>         return $ case state of
>             Running -> True
>             Restart -> True
>             _ -> False

> isSchedulable :: PPtr TCB -> Bool -> Kernel Bool
> isSchedulable tcbPtr inReleaseQ = do
>     tcb <- getObject tcbPtr
>     if tcbSchedContext tcb == Nothing
>         then return False
>         else do
>             sc <- getSchedContext $ fromJust $ tcbSchedContext tcb
>             runnable <- isRunnable tcbPtr
>             return $! runnable && scRefillMax sc > 0 && not inReleaseQ

\subsubsection{Suspending a Thread}

When a thread is suspended, either explicitly by a TCB invocation or implicitly when it is being destroyed, any operation that it is currently performing must be cancelled.

> suspend :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel ()
> suspend target = do
>     cancelIPC target
>     setThreadState Inactive target
>     tcbSchedDequeue target

\subsubsection{Restarting a Blocked Thread}

The Restart operation forces a thread that has blocked to retry the operation that caused it to block.

The invoked thread will return to the instruction that caused it to enter the kernel prior to blocking. If an IPC is in progress (including a fault IPC), it will be silently aborted. Beware of doing this to restart an atomic send and receive operation --- the thread will retry the send phase, even if it had previously succeeded in sending the message and was waiting for the receive phase to complete.

> restart :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel ()
> restart target = do
>     blocked <- isBlocked target
>     scOpt <- threadGet tcbSchedContext target
>     when blocked $ do
>         cancelIPC target
>         setThreadState Restart target
>         assert (scOpt /= Nothing) "restart: scOpt must not be Nothing"
>         schedContextResume (fromJust scOpt)
>         inReleaseQ <- inReleaseQueue target
>         schedulable <- isSchedulable target inReleaseQ
>         when schedulable $ switchIfRequiredTo target

\subsection{IPC Transfers}

The following function is called before resuming or suspending execution of a thread that has a pending IPC transfer. It looks up the sender and receiver's message buffers (in that order, and skipping the send buffer for a fault IPC), and then transfers the message.

If either of the buffers is missing, then the message will be truncated to include only the part not stored in the buffer.

> doIPCTransfer ::
>         PPtr TCB -> Maybe (PPtr Endpoint) -> Word -> Bool ->
>         PPtr TCB -> Kernel ()
> doIPCTransfer sender endpoint badge grant receiver = do
>         receiveBuffer <- lookupIPCBuffer True receiver
>         fault <- threadGet tcbFault sender

>         case fault of

For normal IPC messages, the message registers are transferred.

>             Nothing -> do
>                 sendBuffer <- lookupIPCBuffer False sender
>                 doNormalTransfer
>                     sender sendBuffer endpoint badge grant
>                     receiver receiveBuffer

If the sent message is a fault IPC, the stored fault is transferred.

>             Just _ -> do
>                 doFaultTransfer badge sender receiver receiveBuffer

Replies sent by the "Reply" and "ReplyRecv" system calls can either be normal IPC replies, or fault replies. In the former case, the transfer is the same as for an IPC send, but there is never a fault, capability grants are always allowed, the badge is always 0, and capabilities are never received with diminished rights (diminished rights are now removed).

> doReplyTransfer :: PPtr TCB -> PPtr Reply -> Kernel ()
> doReplyTransfer sender reply = do
>     recvOpt <- getReplyCaller reply
>     case recvOpt of
>         Nothing -> return ()
>         Just receiver -> do
>             state <- getThreadState receiver
>             assert (state == BlockedOnReply) "doReplyTransfer: thread state must be BlockedOnReply"
>             replyRemove reply
>             fault <- threadGet tcbFault receiver
>             case fault of
>                 Nothing -> do
>                     doIPCTransfer sender Nothing 0 True receiver
>                     setThreadState Running receiver
>                 Just (Timeout badge) -> do
>                     mi <- getMessageInfo sender

>                     mrs <- getMRs sender buf mi
>                     restart <- handleFaultReply (Timeout badge) receiver (msgLabel mi) mrs
>                     threadSet (\tcb -> tcb { tcbFault = Nothing }) receiver
>                     setThreadState (if restart then Restart else Inactive) receiver
>                     runnable <- isRunnable receiver
>                     tcb <- getObject receiver
>                     when (tcbSchedContext tcb /= Nothing && runnable) $ do
>                         refillUnblockCheck $ fromJust $ tcbSchedContext tcb
>                         ready <- refillReady $ fromJust $ tcbSchedContext tcb
>                         sufficient <- refillSufficient (fromJust $ tcbSchedContext tcb) 0
>                         if ready && sufficient
>                             then attemptSwitchTo receiver
>                             else postpone (fromJust $ tcbSchedContext tcb)
>                 Just f -> do

>                     mrs <- getMRs sender buf mi

>                     threadSet (\tcb -> tcb { tcbFault = Nothing }) receiver
>                     setThreadState (if restart then Restart else Inactive) receiver
>                     runnable <- isRunnable receiver

>                                 isHandlerValid <- validTimeoutHandler receiver

\subsubsection{Ordinary IPC}

Ordinary IPC simply transfers all message registers. It requires pointers to the source and destination threads, and also to their respective IPC buffers.

> doNormalTransfer ::
>     PPtr TCB -> Maybe (PPtr Word) -> Maybe (PPtr Endpoint) -> Word -> Bool ->
>     PPtr TCB -> Maybe (PPtr Word) -> Kernel ()
> doNormalTransfer sender sendBuffer endpoint badge canGrant
>         receiver receiveBuffer = do
>         tag <- getMessageInfo sender
>         caps <- if canGrant
>             then lookupExtraCaps sender sendBuffer tag
>                 `catchFailure` const (return [])
>             else return []
>         msgTransferred <- copyMRs sender sendBuffer receiver receiveBuffer $
>                                   msgLength tag
>         tag' <- transferCaps tag caps endpoint receiver receiveBuffer
>         let tag'' = tag' { msgLength = msgTransferred }
>         setMessageInfo receiver tag''
>         asUser receiver $ setRegister badgeRegister badge

\subsubsection{Fault IPC}

If the message is a fault --- either just generated, or loaded from the sender's TCB --- then it will be transferred instead of the sender's message registers. In this case, no pointer to the sender's buffer is required.

The recipient's argument registers are filled in with various information about the nature of the fault and the present state of the faulting thread.

> doFaultTransfer :: Word -> PPtr TCB -> PPtr TCB -> Maybe (PPtr Word) ->
>         Kernel ()
> doFaultTransfer badge sender receiver receiverIPCBuffer = do
>         fault <- threadGet tcbFault sender
>         f <- case fault of
>             Just f -> return f
>             Nothing -> fail "doFaultTransfer: no fault found"
>         (faultLabel, faultMsg) <- makeFaultMessage f sender
>         sent <- setMRs receiver receiverIPCBuffer faultMsg
>         let msgInfo = MI {
>              msgLength = sent,
>              msgExtraCaps = 0,
>              msgCapsUnwrapped = 0,
>              msgLabel = faultLabel }
>         setMessageInfo receiver msgInfo
>         asUser receiver $ setRegister badgeRegister badge

\subsubsection{IPC Capability Transfers}

This function is called when an IPC message includes a capability to transfer. It attempts to perform the transfer, and returns an adjusted messageInfo containing the number of caps transferred and the bitmask of which caps were unwrapped.

> transferCaps :: MessageInfo -> [(Capability, PPtr CTE)] ->
>         Maybe (PPtr Endpoint) -> PPtr TCB -> Maybe (PPtr Word) ->
>         Kernel MessageInfo
> transferCaps info caps endpoint receiver receiveBuffer = do
>     destSlots <- getReceiveSlots receiver receiveBuffer
>     let info' = info { msgExtraCaps = 0, msgCapsUnwrapped = 0 }
>     case receiveBuffer of
>         Nothing -> return info'
>         Just rcvBuffer -> do
>             transferCapsToSlots endpoint rcvBuffer 0
>                 caps destSlots info'

> transferCapsToSlots :: Maybe (PPtr Endpoint) -> PPtr Word -> Int ->
>        [(Capability, PPtr CTE)] -> [PPtr CTE] -> MessageInfo ->
>        Kernel MessageInfo
> transferCapsToSlots _ _ n [] _ mi =
>     return $ mi { msgExtraCaps = fromIntegral n }
> transferCapsToSlots ep rcvBuffer n (capWithSrcSlot:caps) slots mi =
>     constOnFailure (mi { msgExtraCaps = fromIntegral n }) $ do
>         case (cap, ep, slots) of
>             (EndpointCap { capEPPtr = p1 }, Just p2, _) | p1 == p2 -> do
>                 withoutFailure $
>                     setExtraBadge rcvBuffer (capEPBadge cap) n
>                 withoutFailure $ transferAgain slots miCapUnfolded
>             (_, _, destSlot:slots') -> do
>                 cap' <- unifyFailure $ deriveCap srcSlot $ cap
>                 when (isNullCap cap') $ throw undefined
>                 withoutFailure $ cteInsert cap' srcSlot destSlot
>                 withoutFailure $ transferAgain slots' mi
>             _ -> return $ mi { msgExtraCaps = fromIntegral n }
>     where
>        transferAgain = transferCapsToSlots ep rcvBuffer (n + 1) caps
>        miCapUnfolded = mi { msgCapsUnwrapped = msgCapsUnwrapped mi .|. bit n}
>        (cap, srcSlot) = capWithSrcSlot

\subsubsection{Notification Objects}

In the case of notification, the badge from the notification object's data word is loaded into the receiver's badge.

\subsection{Scheduling}

\subsubsection{The Scheduler}

The scheduler will perform one of three actions, depending on the scheduler action field of the global kernel state.

This extra check matches an optimisation in the C fast path, which shortcuts
checking the scheduler bitmaps using implicit knowledge that the current thread
has the highest runnable priority in the system on kernel entry (unless idle).

> scheduleChooseNewThread :: Kernel ()
> scheduleChooseNewThread = do
>     domainTime <- getDomainTime
>     when (domainTime == 0) $ nextDomain
>     chooseThread
>     setSchedulerAction ResumeCurrentThread

> scheduleSwitchThreadFastfail :: PPtr TCB -> PPtr TCB -> Priority -> Priority -> Kernel (Bool)
> scheduleSwitchThreadFastfail curThread idleThread curPrio targetPrio =
>     if curThread /= idleThread
>     then return (targetPrio < curPrio)
>     else return True

> schedule :: Kernel ()
> schedule = do
>         awaken
>         curThread <- getCurThread
>         inq <- inReleaseQueue curThread
>         curSched <- isSchedulable curThread inq
>         action <- getSchedulerAction
>         case action of

The default action is to do nothing; the current thread will resume execution.

>             ResumeCurrentThread -> return ()

An IPC operation may request that the scheduler switch to a specific thread.
We check here that the candidate has the highest priority in the system.

>             SwitchToThread candidate -> do
>                 wasRunnable <- isSchedulable curThread
>                 when wasRunnable (tcbSchedEnqueue curThread)
>
>                 idleThread <- getIdleThread
>                 targetPrio <- threadGet tcbPriority candidate
>                 curPrio <- threadGet tcbPriority curThread
>                 fastfail <- scheduleSwitchThreadFastfail curThread idleThread curPrio targetPrio
>
>                 curDom <- curDomain
>                 highest <- isHighestPrio curDom targetPrio
>
>                 if (fastfail && not highest)
>                     then do
>                         tcbSchedEnqueue candidate
>                         setSchedulerAction ChooseNewThread
>                         scheduleChooseNewThread
>                     else if wasRunnable && curPrio == targetPrio
>                             then do
>                                 tcbSchedAppend candidate
>                                 setSchedulerAction ChooseNewThread
>                                 scheduleChooseNewThread
>                             else do
>                                 switchToThread candidate
>                                 setSchedulerAction ResumeCurrentThread

If the current thread is no longer runnable, has used its entire timeslice, an IPC cancellation has potentially woken multiple higher priority threads, or the domain timeslice is exhausted, then we scan the scheduler queues to choose a new thread. In the last case, we switch to the next domain beforehand.

>             ChooseNewThread -> do
>                 curSchedulable <- isSchedulable curThread
>                 when curSchedulable $ tcbSchedEnqueue curThread
>                 scheduleChooseNewThread
>         scAndTimer

Threads are scheduled using a simple multiple-priority round robin algorithm.
It checks the priority bitmaps to find the highest priority with a non-empty
queue. It selects the first thread in that queue and makes it the current
thread.

Note that the ready queues are a separate structure in the kernel
model. In a real implementation, to avoid requiring
dynamically-allocated kernel memory, these queues would be linked
lists using the TCBs themselves as nodes.

Note also that the level 2 bitmap array is stored in reverse in order to get better cache locality for the more common case of higher priority threads.

> countLeadingZeros :: (Bits b, FiniteBits b) => b -> Int
> countLeadingZeros w =
>     length . takeWhile not . reverse . map (testBit w) $ [0 .. finiteBitSize w - 1]

> wordLog2 :: (Bits b, FiniteBits b) => b -> Int
> wordLog2 w = finiteBitSize w - 1 - countLeadingZeros w

> invertL1Index :: Int -> Int
> invertL1Index i = l2BitmapSize - 1 - i

> getHighestPrio :: Domain -> Kernel (Priority)
> getHighestPrio d = do
>     l1 <- getReadyQueuesL1Bitmap d
>     let l1index = wordLog2 l1
>     let l1indexInverted = invertL1Index l1index
>     l2 <- getReadyQueuesL2Bitmap d l1indexInverted
>     let l2index = wordLog2 l2
>     return $ l1IndexToPrio l1index .|. fromIntegral l2index

> isHighestPrio :: Domain -> Priority -> Kernel (Bool)
> isHighestPrio d p = do
>     l1 <- getReadyQueuesL1Bitmap d
>     if l1 == 0
>         then return True
>         else do
>             hprio <- getHighestPrio d
>             return (p >= hprio)

> chooseThread :: Kernel ()
> chooseThread = do
>     curdom <- if numDomains > 1 then curDomain else return 0
>     l1 <- getReadyQueuesL1Bitmap curdom
>     if l1 /= 0
>         then do
>             prio <- getHighestPrio curdom
>             queue <- getQueue curdom prio
>             let thread = head queue
>             runnable <- isRunnable thread
>             assert runnable "Scheduled a non-runnable thread"
>             switchToThread thread
>         else
>             switchToIdleThread

\subsubsection{Switching Threads}

To switch to a new thread, we call the architecture-specific thread switch function, remove the new current thread from the ready queues, and then set the current thread pointer.

> switchToThread :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel ()
> switchToThread thread = do
>         Arch.switchToThread thread
>         tcbSchedDequeue thread
>         setCurThread thread

Switching to the idle thread is similar, except that we call a different architecture-specific idle thread switch function. Also, the conditional enqueue of the current thread is unnecessary, because we never switch to the idle thread when the current thread is runnable.

> switchToIdleThread :: Kernel ()
> switchToIdleThread = do
>         thread <- getIdleThread

\subsubsection{Changing a Thread's Domain}

The following function is used to alter a thread's domain.

> setDomain :: PPtr TCB -> Domain -> Kernel ()
> setDomain tptr newdom = do
>         curThread <- getCurThread
>         tcbSchedDequeue tptr
>         threadSet (\t -> t { tcbDomain = newdom }) tptr
>         runnable <- isRunnable tptr
>         when runnable $ tcbSchedEnqueue tptr
>         when (tptr == curThread) $ rescheduleRequired

\subsubsection{Changing a thread's MCP}

> setMCPriority :: PPtr TCB -> Priority -> Kernel ()
> setMCPriority tptr prio = do
>         threadSet (\t -> t { tcbMCP = prio }) tptr

\subsubsection{Changing a Thread's Priority}

> threadSetPriority :: PPtr TCB -> Priority -> Kernel ()
> threadSetPriority tptr prio = threadSet (\tcb -> tcb { tcbPriority = prio }) tptr

The following function is used to alter the priority of a thread.

> setPriority :: PPtr TCB -> Priority -> Kernel ()
> setPriority tptr prio = do
>     tcbSchedDequeue tptr
>     threadSetPriority tptr prio
>     ts <- getThreadState tptr
>     runnable <- isRunnable tptr
>     when runnable $ do
>         tcbSchedEnqueue tptr
>         cur <- getCurThread
>         when (tptr == cur) rescheduleRequired
>     case (epBlocked ts) of
>         Just ep -> reorderEp ep tptr
>         _ -> return ()
>     case (ntfnBlocked ts) of
>         Just ntfn -> reorderNtfn ntfn tptr
>         _ -> return ()

\subsubsection{Switching to Woken Threads}

A successful IPC transfer will normally wake a thread other than the current
thread. At the point of waking we neither know whether the current thread will
block, or whether the woken thread has the highest priority.  We note the woken
thread as a candidate if it is a valid switch target, and examine its
importance in the scheduler. If the woken thread is not a viable switch
candidate, we enqueue it instead. In the case of multiple candidates, all
candidates are enqueued.

> possibleSwitchTo :: PPtr TCB -> Bool -> Kernel ()
> possibleSwitchTo target onSamePrio = do
>     scOpt <- threadGet tcbSchedContext target
>     inq <- inReleaseQueue target
>     when (scOpt /= Nothing && not inq) $ do
>       curDom <- curDomain
>       targetDom <- threadGet tcbDomain target
>       action <- getSchedulerAction
>       if (targetDom /= curDom)
>           then tcbSchedEnqueue target
>           else if (action /= ResumeCurrentThread)
>                   then do
>                       rescheduleRequired
>                       tcbSchedEnqueue target
>                 else setSchedulerAction $ SwitchToThread target

In most cases, the current thread has just sent a message to the woken thread, so we switch if the woken thread has the same or higher priority than the current thread; that is, whenever the priorities permit the switch.

\subsubsection{Cancelling Stored Scheduler Action}

This function is called when the system state has changed sufficiently that the stored scheduler action may be invalid. It safely discards any stored state and organises for a full reschedule to be performed.

> rescheduleRequired :: Kernel ()
> rescheduleRequired = do
>     action <- getSchedulerAction
>     case action of
>         SwitchToThread target -> do
>              inReleaseQ <- inReleaseQueue target
>              sched <- isSchedulable target inReleaseQ
>              when sched $ tcbSchedEnqueue target
>         _ -> return ()
>     setSchedulerAction ChooseNewThread

\subsubsection{Scheduling Parameters}

A trivial function is provided to fetch the current scheduler state of
a thread.

> getThreadState :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel ThreadState
> getThreadState = threadGet tcbState

> setThreadState :: ThreadState -> PPtr TCB -> Kernel ()
> setThreadState ts tptr = do
>         tcb <- getObject tptr
>         setObject tptr $ tcb { tcbState = ts }
>         scheduleTCB tptr

\subsubsection{Bound Notificaion objects}

> getBoundNotification :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel (Maybe (PPtr Notification))
> getBoundNotification = threadGet tcbBoundNotification

> setBoundNotification :: Maybe (PPtr Notification) -> PPtr TCB -> Kernel ()
> setBoundNotification ntfnPtr tptr = threadSet (\t -> t { tcbBoundNotification = ntfnPtr }) tptr

\subsubsection{Scheduler Queue Manipulation}

The following two functions place a thread at the beginning or end of its priority's ready queue, unless it is already queued.

%TODO: document

> prioToL1Index :: Priority -> Int
> prioToL1Index prio = fromIntegral $ prio `shiftR` wordRadix

> l1IndexToPrio :: Int -> Priority
> l1IndexToPrio i = (fromIntegral i) `shiftL` wordRadix

> getReadyQueuesL1Bitmap :: Domain -> Kernel (Word)

> modifyReadyQueuesL1Bitmap :: Domain -> (Word -> Word) -> Kernel ()
> modifyReadyQueuesL1Bitmap tdom f = do
>     l1 <- getReadyQueuesL1Bitmap tdom
>     modify (\ks -> ks { ksReadyQueuesL1Bitmap =
>                             ksReadyQueuesL1Bitmap ks // [(tdom, f l1)]})

> getReadyQueuesL2Bitmap :: Domain -> Int -> Kernel (Word)
> getReadyQueuesL2Bitmap tdom i = gets (\ks -> ksReadyQueuesL2Bitmap ks ! (tdom, i))

> modifyReadyQueuesL2Bitmap :: Domain -> Int -> (Word -> Word) -> Kernel ()
> modifyReadyQueuesL2Bitmap tdom i f = do
>     l2 <- getReadyQueuesL2Bitmap tdom i
>     modify (\ks -> ks { ksReadyQueuesL2Bitmap =
>                             ksReadyQueuesL2Bitmap ks // [((tdom, i), f l2)]})

> addToBitmap :: Domain -> Priority -> Kernel ()
> addToBitmap tdom prio = do
>     let l1index = prioToL1Index prio
>     let l1indexInverted = invertL1Index l1index
>     let l2bit = fromIntegral ((fromIntegral prio .&. mask wordRadix)::Word)
>     modifyReadyQueuesL1Bitmap tdom $ \w -> w .|. bit l1index
>     modifyReadyQueuesL2Bitmap tdom l1indexInverted
>         (\w -> w .|. bit l2bit)

> removeFromBitmap :: Domain -> Priority -> Kernel ()
> removeFromBitmap tdom prio = do
>     let l1index = prioToL1Index prio
>     let l1indexInverted = invertL1Index l1index
>     let l2bit = fromIntegral((fromIntegral prio .&. mask wordRadix)::Word)
>     modifyReadyQueuesL2Bitmap tdom l1indexInverted $
>         (\w -> w .&. (complement $ bit l2bit))
>     l2 <- getReadyQueuesL2Bitmap tdom l1indexInverted
>     when (l2 == 0) $
>         modifyReadyQueuesL1Bitmap tdom $
>             (\w -> w .&. (complement $ bit l1index))

> tcbSchedEnqueue :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel ()
> tcbSchedEnqueue thread = do
>     queued <- threadGet tcbQueued thread
>     unless queued $ do
>         tdom <- threadGet tcbDomain thread
>         prio <- threadGet tcbPriority thread
>         queue <- getQueue tdom prio
>         setQueue tdom prio $ thread : queue
>         when (null queue) $ addToBitmap tdom prio
>         threadSet (\t -> t { tcbQueued = True }) thread

> tcbSchedAppend :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel ()
> tcbSchedAppend thread = do
>     queued <- threadGet tcbQueued thread
>     unless queued $ do
>         tdom <- threadGet tcbDomain thread
>         prio <- threadGet tcbPriority thread
>         queue <- getQueue tdom prio
>         setQueue tdom prio $ queue ++ [thread]
>         when (null queue) $ addToBitmap tdom prio
>         threadSet (\t -> t { tcbQueued = True }) thread

The following function dequeues a thread, if it is queued.

> tcbSchedDequeue :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel ()
> tcbSchedDequeue thread = do
>     queued <- threadGet tcbQueued thread
>     when queued $ do
>         tdom <- threadGet tcbDomain thread
>         prio <- threadGet tcbPriority thread
>         queue <- getQueue tdom prio
>         let queue' = filter (/=thread) queue
>         setQueue tdom prio queue'
>         when (null queue') $ removeFromBitmap tdom prio
>         threadSet (\t -> t { tcbQueued = False }) thread

\section{Kernel Init}

Kernel init will created a initial thread whose tcbPriority is max priority.

> initTCB = (makeObject::TCB){ tcbPriority=maxBound }

> endTimeslice :: Bool -> Kernel ()
> endTimeslice canTimeoutFault = do
>     ct <- getCurThread
>     it <- getIdleThread
>     when (ct /= it) $ do
>         scPtr <- getCurSc
>         ready <- refillReady scPtr
>         sufficient <- refillSufficient scPtr 0
>         valid <- validTimeoutHandler ct
>         if (canTimeoutFault && valid)
>             then handleTimeout ct
>             else
>                 if ready && sufficient
>                     then do
>                         cur <- getCurThread
>                         tcbSchedAppend cur
>                     else postpone scPtr

> inReleaseQueue :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel Bool
> inReleaseQueue tcbPtr = do
>     releaseQueue <- getReleaseQueue
>     return $! member tcbPtr (fromList releaseQueue)

> tcbReleaseRemove :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel ()
> tcbReleaseRemove tcbPtr = do
>     releaseQueue <- getReleaseQueue
>     setReleaseQueue (filter (/=tcbPtr) releaseQueue)

> switchIfRequiredTo :: PPtr TCB -> Kernel ()
> switchIfRequiredTo target = possibleSwitchTo target False
