architecture-specific facilities are provided through the @{text arch_cap} type.

text {* Thread Control Blocks are the in-kernel representation of a thread.

Threads which can execute are either in the Running state for normal execution,
in the Restart state if their last operation has not completed yet or in the
IdleThreadState for the unique system idle thread. Threads can also be blocked
waiting for any of the different kinds of system messages. The Inactive state
indicates that the TCB is not currently used by a running thread.

TCBs also contain some special-purpose capability slots. The CTable slot is a
capability to a CNode through which the thread accesses capabilities with which
to perform system calls. The VTable slot is a capability to a virtual address
space (an architecture-specific capability type) in which the thread runs. The
IPCFrame slot stores a capability to a memory frame (an architecture-specific
capability type) through which messages will be sent and received.

If the thread has encountered a fault and is waiting to send it to its
supervisor the fault is stored in @{text tcb_fault}. The user register file is
stored in @{text tcb_context}, the pointer to the cap in the IPCFrame slot in
@{text tcb_ipc_buffer} and the identity of the Endpoint cap through which faults
are to be sent in @{text tcb_fault_handler}.

Note: for each irq, @{text "interrupt_irq_node irq"} points to a cnode which
